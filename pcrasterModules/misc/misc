Forking problem 8 februari 2012
----------------------------------

This folder contains my own originals.
../pcrasterPythonModulesFromNoemi contains my older originals with some minor changes of
Noemi in it, including some by me to add member vars for filter updates. That folder should not be used
but only considered as old backup in case changes are needed that were made there.

Below I have made a list of stuff copied from Noemi, to update this source dir



Copies from Noemi, 8 februari 2012
